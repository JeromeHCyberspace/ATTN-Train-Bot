This bot spends all your attention resource on training a specified stat (while leaving a set amount of attention to allow you to do other things). For example, I configure the bot to spend any attention I have above 60 on training OPSEC. This leaves me with 60 attention for capturing nodes / browsing cyberspace / etc.
